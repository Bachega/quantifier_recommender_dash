1. From the raw data, Meta-features are extracted.
2. The raw data is normalized via StandardScaler(), a LogisticRegressor() scorer is trained for the Quantifiers and they are evaluated through APP.
3. With the Meta-table + the Quantifiers performance (estimated with APP), we generate the Meta-table.
4. Using the Meta-table, we train the Recommendation system.

RAW DATA ---> META-FEATURES EXTRACTION


RAW DATA ---> STANDARDSCALER() ----> LOGISTICREGRESSION() -----> PERFOMRANCES


META-FEATURES EXTRACTION + PERFORMANCES -----> META-TABLE
